# Nsc

_nsc: (420) No Scope Commits_

This is a small gem intended to help you commit in the Angular Commit style, but
without the commit scope (since we think it's mostly useless). It's modeled after
the great NPM package commitizen, but does not require any sort of configuration
(since it's already really opinionated).

```bash
gem install nsc
```

```bash
nsc commit
```
